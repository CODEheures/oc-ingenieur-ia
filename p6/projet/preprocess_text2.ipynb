      "Would give zero stars if possible. Carries literally zero lefty golf clubs for juniors. Does this corrupt corporation think that it's okay to discriminate against 10% of the world population? I will, most definitely, never be returning to this store again. Also, Jared, the man who helped me, was an absolute asshole. Would not recommend at all. Didn't even have bike parking.\n",

      "I got some friends a room at the JW for the night as a gift the night of their wedding.  The only request I made of the front desk was that the bride and groom would not have to worry about any expenses.  2 of us separately went down and gave credit cards to the front desk to make sure everything was taken care of.  I got a phone call at 11:30 that night from the bride and groom saying that they were being asked to pay for parking.  Huge fail JW.  When I asked to talk to the manager, all he did was make excuses.  No apologies, no reassurance that they would be well taken care of for the rest of their stay.  If you want a seamless stay, this is not the place.  Huge disappointment.\n",

      "I had high hopes for this place since the parking lot was full. I ordered fish and chips, and got peas and macaroni and cheese on the side. My companion ordered the knackwurst and saurerkraut with mashed potatoes on the side. The main courses were all right. The macaroni and cheese was inedible for me. The flavoring tasted very artificial. My companion's mashed potatoes tasted like paper. We have eaten at enough establishments like this to know we can get better quality food for more affordable prices. We will not be returning.\n",

      "House of Beauty is an absolute sham, and possibly a scam!  I ordered products from them some years ago, and waited a ridiculously long time to receive them.  I decided to try them again recently, ordered my products online more than 6 weeks ago, and have received NOTHING!  No one ever answers their phone, and I have written several emails with no response whatsoever.  DO NOT order anything from these people, they are terrible!\n",

      "The food was great...however the wait staff was so bad it was incredible.  He not only insulted us as we complained about our 2 hour wait for our entrees, but insisted we weren't there that long and that we were just \"hangry\".  He said it's okay you're mad I understand you're hangry.  Never did a manager come to talk to us, even after a guest in our party went to talk to the chefs...they were dumbfounded...because we realized the kitchen never had our order!! One bad server shouldn't describe a restaurant, however the manager should have come and the server should accept his ignorance.  Really poor experience. :(\n",

      "The wife and I have had 3 or 4 pizza's here. In our opinion, we found the pizza dough to have little or no taste. The pizza sauce tastes like it came right out of a can. We generally get a vegetarian pizza loaded but even with all those veggies, there still isn't much taste.\n",
      "We also generally get a side salad with a dressing (dressings seemed to have come out of a can). But even the salads (lettuce and tomatoes) have no spices on them. This is suppose to be a pizza restaurant. Where are the Italian spices?\n",

      "Waited an hour for a Caesar salad with a tiny chicken finger on it that cost an extra $5. Sadly the hour wait was the typical story of the night for anyone that stopped here during GMX. The place did not seem that busy as far as restaurants go, so maybe they're not used to the traffic. \n",
      "\n",
      "The salad was not worth $15. If I hadn't gotten it with chicken I would have been sorely disappointed, though it was sad even with the $5 chicken finger on it. \n",

      "I've frequented this place with a friend several times but no matter how many times I come here, I always forget to bring cash. It is an extra mile to venture outside of this area to a bank to get some cash and come all of the way back. It's an established place where New Orleanians come for wings, Cajun fries, and the famous ghetto punch! It's the most delicious punch I've ever had: not too sweet, not bitter, and a natural blend of flavors for the perfect punch.\n",
      "\n",
      "After getting your cash, you would need to park under the bridge and walk across the street. Be careful and pay attention to the light. Keep your car locked and keep an eye out. At this locations there is no place to sit and eat, and it's not really comfortable to order and wait. You're standing the entire time, outside a pickup window; you can imagine how packed it may get if it rains or gets really cold outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, l think the wings are rather dry: they could use some juice or some oil to keep them juicy. The fries I love, but not more than I love the punch! Get a large if you can; you won't regret it. It's a little bit of a hassle, this place; Yet and still, the food is enough for customers to keep coming back.\n",

Ed's is huge. If you've ever been on a cruise ship, Ed's has a variety of activity spaces, restaurant, bars and lounges under one roof. \n",

      "It's endless entertainment. You could probably float around here for a whole week and never get bored. There is a pool room, video games, bowling, a dance area, restaurants, lounges, a stage and much more around every corner you turn. It's a good place for young kids and birthday parties once you're too old for Chucky Cheese. \n",

      "Although I've personally never seen a band here my partner has, and it's not that expensive to see good bands like Ween, Jurassic Five or Interpol. The venue's neither big or small, so Ed's can host lesser known but interesting musicians as they can sell upwards of 600 tickets. So for bands that aren't popular enough to fill the Coliseum, Ed's still helps them establish a presence in E-town.\n",

      "This place is a hidden gem.  It's at an odd spot on Route 130 with only one-way access, and I've seen at least three different restaurants come and go in my life.  I hope thought that Dolan's stays.\n",
      "\n",
      "A family friend mentioned the place a little under a year ago, soon after they opened up.  I was skeptical at first, but the food convinced me that the place is a keeper.  Everything is rich in flavor whether it's the burgers, the appetizers, or any one of the entrees.  Ingredients are mostly local as another reviewer said, aside from a few oddballs like their sharp Irish cheddar which is imported.  (Sent as the entire wax-packed cheese wheel as one waitress said.  Very classy.)  Draft selection is good.  Chips are fried in house, and they make their own ketchup which is nothing short of delicious.  (This is coming from a guy who doesn't like ketchup.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Service is slow as someone else mentioned, but I imagine that it's due to the food being cooked mostly start to finish at the time of ordering for freshness.  (For better or for worse, it's usually pretty quiet.  Best to not to let ingredients sit out for too long by the prep station, waiting to be cooked, you know?)  It's not a bother though.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only major complaint is the acoustics.  The restaurant is all hard surfaces, and it's amplified echoes galore wherever you are.  Don't go talking about your recent colonoscopy or workplace drama as most of the restaurant will hear it.  Also, they have themed nights. It's a nice idea, and some stuff looks fun, but Friday night--if I remember correctly--is live music.  When I was there, it ended up being a folk singer with a hi-top table of his homely, old groupies catcalling throughout every song in his set, perfectly timed as if it was a bloody live showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Loud, annoying, and truly dreadful.  In fairness though, that's what happens when you put live music and groupies in a small, resonant space.  Fortunately, the food was still good, and the show eventually stopped.\n",

      "Love the food at El Tumi, but it is truly family run and the service is informal.  But the food makes this a gem- unique flavors and tastes from a country most of us have not visited.  Start with the great green salsa and chips.  The palta rellena salad with avocados stuffed with vegies is awesome.  Entree are really good also.  My fav beef is lomo al jugo, beef with sauteed onions and tomatoes.  Aji de Gallina, chicken in a cream sauce with Peruvian yellow spice is a good choice also.  Both of the Peruvian drinks chicha morada and cebada are different but a good accompaniment for the food.  Prices are extremely reasonable. Altogether, the kind of restaurant that makes a city a great place to live. I'll be working my way through the menu enjoying the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pricey for burgers and beer but very tasty. Get the rooster sauce for your fries, its a mayonaise flavored  sauce. Cool building and vibe with a modern industrial look. Would have given 5 stars if the beers offerings were larger for the price.\n",

      "Kudos to this place for providing a much needed late night snack while I was visiting Nashville! Didn't have to wait on delivery because they allowed pick-up at 2 AM! Pizza honestly looked like it wasn't going to be all that great but LOOKS WERE DECEIVING! The pizza was delicious and my only regret was that I didn't order a bigger one!\n",

      "A WORD OF CAUTION: my car was broken into in broad daylight in a seemingly active parking lot off of Lincoln Drive.    I foolishly forgot to hide some bags on my back seat and sure enough I came back to a broken window.   We did find almost evrerything a short distance away minus the valuables.  My advice is lock everything out of sight in your trunk and park on the street if possible.   I usually am smarter but made a mistake.    A few passersby shared with me that this is a pretty common occurrence, but I think it can be easily avoided with a few precautions.\n",

      "Kanella carries a well-deserved reputation as a prime brunch spot in Philly. Luck smiled on my party of three, as we snagged a last-minute reservation at noon (you should plan further in advance than we did). I echo other reviewers' sentiments concerning the decor at Kanella; as I walked in, the antique exposed brick and blue/white color scheme tempoarily transported me back to the Cycladic Islands. Chef Pitsillides kept the illusion going with his typically Mediterranean hospitality. He checked on our table thrice to make sure we felt welcomed, and indeed the constant attention and care we received has earned Kanella a return visit on that merit alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "That isn't to downplay his Cypriot fare; the food is absolutely delicious. One can only indulge in so many variations of french toast or eggs benedict before growing bored, and Kanella's vibrant, rustic plates certainly enliven the palette and restore one's faith in brunch. We commenced our meal with the obligatory dip trio, which served up pumpkin-feta, spicy tomato, and white bean dips in lieu of the stereotypical hummus and baba. Each scored high marks from the table, with the pumpkin cruising into first with an interesting briny-earthy-sweet interplay. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other dishes ordered included the baked duck egg, potatoes with tzatziki, and a special lamb tongue stew. Though small in portion, the duck egg showed deft execution with a crispy but ever-so-slightly-creamy fried egg crowning well-seasoned, toothsome greens in yogurt sauce. The potatoes had a similarly crisp texture with fluffy innards, and paired beautifully with accompanying minty, rich tzatziki. The tongue stew offered a heaping plate of creamy giant beans and tender, pleasantly funky lamb tongue pieces in a vibrantly flavored sauce. With a squeeze of lemon juice, a dollop of accompanying Greek yogurt, and a last-minute side order of extra grilled pita, the dish served as a hearty, memorable combination of flavors and textures.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a change of pace in the Philly dining scene, or simply for Chef Pitsillides welcoming demeanor and crazy-good plates, head to Kanella and get whisked away to the Aegean for an hour or so.\n",

      "Delicious and great prices! I had the brisket tacos, baked beans and mac n cheese. Pass on the mac and go for cornbread instead. The tacos were delicious, but if you want a bigger portion of the brisket, you'll have to be there around lunch. We went for dinner at 5 and they were nearly out of brisket. I had the oh honey! to drink and loved it. Nice ambience, no issue with service or waiting in line.\n",
